          <p>
            In groups of four, pick one representation of AI (or computer technology more generally) in a recent book, film, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have three minutes to discuss how this representation can be percieved from a positive, or utopian perspective, and from a negative or dystopian perspective.
            At the end, you'll have one minute to report your findings back to the room!

            We are clearly in an early yet exciting stage of the IoT with lots of ideas and products, some good, some bad.
          </p>
          <p>
            In groups of 4, conceive and design a &quot;future object&quot; for the Internet of Things.
            This should be a smart or IoT object which does not yet exist, but would serve some purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the excercise you will pitch your idea to the group, explaining how it would work, and why we might want this product and how it will change our lives, and the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other groups will give your pitch a score out of ten.
