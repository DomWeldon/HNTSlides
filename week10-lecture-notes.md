# Networked Technologies: Network Thinking

"Twenty" minute lecture on uniting concepts of the course and in particular the seminars together.

## Plenary
* [**Kaliningrad**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaliningrad) - city in Russia, home to around 450,000 people.
* Previously **Königsberg** home to [Leonard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler), influential Swiss mathematician in the eighteenth century. Developed the problem of the [**Seven Bridges of Königsberg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg) in 1736, which led to the foundation of [*Graph Theory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory#History) which we discussed in lecture one of this course.

### The Problem

* The City of Königsberg is set on both sides of the Pregel River, with two islands in the middle of the river which are connected to each other and both sides of the city by seven bridges.
* Aim is to devise a route, starting and ending anywhere, that will **cross every bridge once and only once**.
* The solution is impossible, but Euler's Graph Theory analysis proves this assertion mathematically.

## Graph Theory
* Branch of mathematics dealing with networks and network theory.
* Essential to lots of mathematical modeling, and network analysis.
* Key to mathematical and technical development of the Internet.
  * In this course we have discussed it in references to **nodes**, representing entities or points, and **edges** representing the connections or relationships between these entities or points.
  * Together nodes and edges form a **network**.
  * We measure the properties of a network, or nodes in it using concepts like **centrality**, the **shortest path**, **network diameter** etc.
  * We can describe networks based on these properties, for example **short world networks**.

## Network Thinking and Network Approach
* The course has looked at the development of network technologies, from telegraphy all the way to the internet of things.
* But we've also looked at these developments from a **network approach** to try and encourage you to become **network thinkers**.

### What We've Covered
* In the lectures and the seminars we've covered networks from, as we described in one seminar, *cables to consciousness*. Now let's recap:
  * **The Internet**. *A network of computers that are capable of communicating with one another in order to transfer information between them*. Packet switching, common protocols like TCP/IP, computers with physical and electromagnetic connections between them: routers, hosts, cables, fibre optics, satellites, etc. Development from ARPANET in 1969 to the contemporary Internet, originally a military network, now a global public network.
  * **The World Wide Web**. *A network of linked documents which are accessible using the internet.* Developed from the concept of a hyper-text. Standards published by Tim Berners-Leee in 1989-1991, originally an academic network, now a global public network of information.
  * **Social Networks**. *A set of WWW and Web 2.0 technologies which allow people to conduct their social interactions online, forming a network in which people are the nodes.* Early history from the 2000s onwards.
  * **IoT: Networks of Things**. *The incorporation of everyday devices into the Internet.* Devices become "smart" through their connection to the Internet and in doing so reform our daily lived experiences. Is this the future of the Internet?
  * **Network Society**. *How individuals and organisations interact, often facilitated by technology, and in doing so form and reform society*. Thinking by Castells et al. Network theories of power. How are our consciousnesses (our "neural networks") fashioned by networks.

## Networks as Subjects
So, we've learned a lot about these networks and their history, and how they have developed and been shaped by humans. But, how have they shaped us? How do networks exert power over ourselves and societies?
* Bruno Latour, very famous French social theorist and once of the main proponents of **Actor Network Theory**, a theory used primarily in *Science and Technology Studies*.
  * You don't need to learn anything about ANT just yet, or include it in your essays
  * It's a contentious term, and is heavily criticised in very dense literature.
  * But, one of its main arguments is that non-human actors can exert power and agency in societies
* Networks, especially the Internet, shape our lives.

Think about the power that your phone has over you, how it's able to control parts of your life and you ineract with it as a person.

Castell's concept of network power, the power of networks to condition our lives and make us conform to a common standard is similar.

As we can see from historical examples like the Simpsons that I've included in the seminars, networked technologies have become integral to our lives, and they are shaping it in ways beyond the control of any one individual.

We'll be covering one especially contentious political issue, Net Neutrality, in tomorrow's seminar. But for the time being, I want to argue one final point to you all to sum up why you've been doing this course and what it's all about.

## Timeline

To do that, I've constructed a timeline for all the events in this course, which is available as a PDF online, too.

* Ike elected
* Sputnik
* ARPA
* Packet Switching
* ARPANET
* TCP adopted by ARPANET
* WWW developed
* WWW goes public
* 2000 - y2k bug
* Social Networks
* Place based networks
* Web 2.0
* IoT launch
* Net Neutrality

* this generation will live for 100 years?


## You are the future of how the internet works for or against individuals

Geeks vs. socially informed users of the internet.
